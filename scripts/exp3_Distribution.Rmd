```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
library(rdist)
library(sf)
library(readr)

source("./functions/initation_functions.R")
source("./functions/land_updating.R")
source("./functions/visualisation.R")

```

Each 3000 would be one local town

Each psp a town centre?
  
Inner circles to have 

```{r cars}
person_per_hh <- 2.6
share_land_for_dest <- 0.25

densities <- seq(from = 15, to = 55, by = 2.5)
pixl_diameter <- 0.1
nbhd_diameter <- 0.8
```

## Tasks to complete here:
- 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
